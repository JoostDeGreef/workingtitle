Cartesian coordinates of a regular dodecahedron in the following:
 * the orange vertices lie at (±1, ±1, ±1).
 * the green vertices lie at (0, ±ϕ, ±⁠1/ϕ⁠) and form a rectangle on the yz-plane.
 * the blue vertices lie at (±⁠1/ϕ⁠, 0, ±ϕ) and form a rectangle on the xz-plane.
 * the pink vertices lie at (±ϕ, ±1/ϕ⁠, 0) and form a rectangle on the xy-plane.
