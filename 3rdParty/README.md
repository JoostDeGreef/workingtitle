# 3rdParty

Projects from other sources, configured so that they align with my projects.

To avoid copyright issues, there should be no code here, only scripting to 
get/download, configure, update, build etc.

'update.sh' : script which will get all the sources and perform configuration.  
'proper.sh' : remove all foreign/generated/compiled files.
